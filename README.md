# Santa-Clara-Valley-Public-Transportation-Prediction-


**Project Goals:**

**Objective:**

To Predict the Number of Boardings for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation. 

**Importance:** 

Achieving these goals is essential for **efficient resource allocation**, **minimizing wait times for passengers**, and **reduce the crowd during peak hours** This prediction model will assist in route planning, financial forecasting, and enhancing the overall passenger experience.

**Data Availability:** 

We have access to the ridership by route dataset and a productivity matrix from the local transit authority.

**Data Types**: 

Our datasets consist of numerical variables like boarding counts and hours of operation, and categorical variables like route identifiers.

**Methods:**

**Analytical Approaches:** 

Our analysis incorporates statistical methods and machine learning models, including cross-validation to prevent overfitting and Random Forest for its robustness against noise.

**Implementation Plan:**

The project will follow these phases: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model building, and results interpretation.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

Potential Challenges: Challenges we faced during the project was underfitting.

**Solutions:** 

We implemented cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and developing a clear integration plan to achieve our objective.
